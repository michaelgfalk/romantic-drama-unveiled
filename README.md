# Romantic Drama Unveiled

## Aim

The drama of the Romantic period is virtually forgotten today. Ibsen and Shakespeare command the stage across the English-speaking world, and there is little room for the loud, exuberant, silly, climactic, rebellious drama of two hundred years ago.

This visualisation aims to unveil this forgotten realm of drama to a new public.
